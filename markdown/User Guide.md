# User Guide

Welcome to the User Guide! This article will tell you what to do first!

## Getting Started

To get started with cmdR follow the necessary steps:

### 1. Install the Necessary Tools

For detailed installation steps, refer to the [cmdR Installation Guide](?article=Installing cmdR).

### 2. Configure Your Environment

Set up your environment by configuring the necessary settings:

- **LoadString**: For some packages to work, you may need to enable LoadString. If you install a package that requires LoadString, don't worry. We will make sure to tell you.
- **The Plugin** Please be sure that you install the plugin. To learn the different ways to install cmdR please see the article here: [button:Installing cmdR](?article=Installing cmdR)
#### Important Notes
- **Game Security**: Please make sure before you install a package, you are sure you can trust the package you are installing. Please make sure you are not installing the wrong package as some packages may be malicious. If you have installed a malicious package don't worry, it is super easy to get rid of it! Just click delete on the malicious package folder.
- **Package Advertizements**: (Ads do have to follow a strict display and moderation policy) Please be aware some packages may have code that could create ad GUI's. To get rid of the ad GUI's you will just need to do 1 of the following:
  1. You can find the the piece of code creating the ads and delete it. **Please be mindful**: By deleting certain snippets of code you could cause the package not to work. Please make sure you know what you are doing.\n
  2. (Coming Soon) You can go into the package's "cmdRConfig" file and set can display ads to false. It is against our policy to make a package not\n run without ads. (Minor exceptions must be approved by us). Package have forced ads? (Package does not work if you delete the ads.) Please report it to us!
  3. In the future we may create a cmdR pro version where you could have no ads.
- **Game Storage**: Please understand that some packages can be very big. This could slow down your game and effect your users experience. Here are some tips to free up some storage:
  1. **Delete old package versions** If you have a previous package version installed, then after updating your code you can remove the outdated package from your game.\n
  2. **Find "mini packages"** In the future some packages may have mini versions with the same or about the same features as the normal sized package just takes up less space! Will use our script compressor (Coming Soon)\n
  3. **Delete unneeded packages** Have any unneeded packages that you don't need? Get rid of them!\n

For detailed configuration instructions, see the [Getting Started With cmdR](?article=Getting Started).
